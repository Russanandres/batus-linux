# BatusLin.sh
this is the sh where the standard bash commands for *nix are collected in one place.

Russian only version now!

### Since version 1.1 batus for Android (Termux), Linux and Mac OS X have been merged into one file BatusLin.sh!

## Installing and running
Before run check executing permissions.
Type in terminal:

$: ```sudo chmod +x BatusLin.sh```

$: ```./BatusLin.sh```

## WARNING MACOS X!!
Before running the script on macOS, write these 2 commands:

$: ```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

$: ```brew install dialog```

They needs root permissions

All versions BatusMac.sh tested on Catalina on vmware! There may be bugs and glitches!

## Editing
i wrote all the code in kate.

The source code is clearly open source

## Other OS than linux
Android - batus in Android works with Termux. Use Linux versions.

Android recovery - Working legacy versions like iPhone builds. Use BFR.zip in all verisons.

WearOS - Works good in Termux. Use Linux versions.

Mac OS X - Works good. Tested on OS X Catalina. Some features have not been tested. Use Linux versions.

BSD - I have no way to check the work, but I think it will start.

PocketBook - Works good, but need special release.

PSVita/XMB - I couldn't find a terminal. BFLS will be supported if there is a bash port. For PlayStation 2/3 use PS2/3Linux.

WSL2 - Works good. Use Linux versions. Install dialog before starting!

SailfishOS - I have no way to check the work, but I think it will start.

Ubuntu touch - I have no way to check the work, but I think it will start.

ChromeOS/ChromiumOS - I have no way to check the work, but I think it will start.

ios/ipadOS and etc - NEEDS JAILBREAK!!! There is no support due to the lack of dialog. Tested on iPhone 4s ios 6.1.3. Older versions without dialog work well with jailbreak. Perhaps versions with dialog work, but I don't know how to put it in the system. Use special releases in the "For Legacy Systems" directory.

OS/2 - You can run in theory, but this has not been tested.

Symbian S60 9.3 - It is possible to launch only if the phone has a touch screen. I have nokia without it(

*-DOS and etc legacy systems older than 2005 idk - there is no way to run.

### Other systems will be tested.
