## Other OS than linux
Android - batus in Android works with Termux. Use Linux versions.

Mac OS X - Works good. Tested on OS X Catalina. Some features have not been tested. Use Linux versions.

BSD - I have no way to check the work.

WSL2 - Works good. Use Linux versions.

ios/ipadOS and etc - There is no support due to the lack of dialog. Tested on iPhone 4s ios 6.1.3. It may be possible to run legacy versions without dialog. They are located here: https://github.com/Russanandres/batus/tree/main/linux%20versions NEEDS JAILBREAK

ChromeOS/ChromiumOS - I have no way to check the work.

*-DOS/OS!2 and etc legacy systems - there is no way to run.
